 ThreadsUsingCProgramming
 
 This is a working implementation of how and when to use processes and threads in our programs or in the Operating System in general. Here,
 I've taken a large earthquake dataset of all-week and all-month, and tried to sort them by dividing them into 'n' number (entered by the
 user) of processes or, threads (again chosen by the user).
 
 It's a relative comparison between the process time (PID time) and thread time to sort the dataset. It's also a hands-on display of Divide-
 And-Conquer algorithm, wherein we are dividing the data-set into several thread groups, sorting each thread group, merging the groups and 
 combining the final result to give us the sorted data-set.
